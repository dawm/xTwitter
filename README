xTwitter is a OAuth+xAuth library for HP Palm webOS
Author: Joshua 'dawm' Spohr (Biocandy Labs)

Current features are as follows:
Authorize (OAuth + xAuth)
Tweet (Send)
Follow
Unfollow
--------------------------------

In order to use this library and the sample application you need to have xAuth access on to your twitter application. This is not automatic and you must send a request to twitter for access. For more information goto http://dev.twitter.com/pages/xauth

For more information on Twitter's xAuth, dohtem (from #webos on irc.freenode.net) found a great article on the subject: http://www.reynoldsftw.com/2010/03/using-xauth-an-alternate-oauth-from-twitter/

Once you have xAuth access on to your twitter application enter your consumer key and consumer secret on line 12 and 13 of sampleApplication/src/app/assistants/main-assistant.js
